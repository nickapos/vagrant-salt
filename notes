grains is that system used to derive informations about the undelying system (like ohai and facter)

had issues with vagrant salt and ubuntu 14.04 and centos 7.0, precise64. there seem to be some bugs in the dependency management
of bootstrap script. only centos 6.6 works somewhat up to a point. it does not fail but the provisioning does not happen either

reverting to manual test & install with centos 6.6 as reference box

i am getting the same error for minion daemon
Starting salt-minion daemon: [ERROR   ] Error parsing configuration file: /etc/salt/minion - conf should be a document, not <type 'str'>.
[  OK  ]

it may be something that has to do with the configuration

in an sls direcroty can 
one sls file can include others creatign that way a tree structure of state files
